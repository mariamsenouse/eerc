# EERC: Your Trusted Partner in IT Asset Recycling

EERC has built its reputation by protecting its clients from liability, gaining the trust of government agencies and international IT companies. As an environmentally friendly company certified by the Ministry of Environment for recycling practices, EERC makes it easy to recycle computers by collecting IT equipment directly from clients' loading docks. Depending on the service needed, hard drives are either destroyed or data is completely wiped using Blanco software, with a certified report provided to confirm the details and data removal.

Additionally, EERC offers enhanced security by transferring highly sensitive data using new secure devices. They take ownership of clients' office equipment, relieving them of responsibility and concerns. By providing high-quality service with high recovery rates in an environmentally safe manner, EERC enables large, medium, and small companies to partner with them for all their recycling needs.

EERC's attention to detail, flexibility, and commitment to customer service are the company's guiding principles, with many major manufacturers and companies relying on them to efficiently and cost-effectively process and manage their obsolete assets.
